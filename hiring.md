I play leadership roles on technical teams, and as such I have been asked to make many decisions about hiring technical team-members. This ranges from those that would report to me - coops, jr. developers - those that would be my peers - sr. engineers, architects and team leads - and those that I would report to  - e.g. VP of Engineering.

When I approach hiring, I angle to assess candidates along the following dimensions:

1) Are they generally interested in the project/company/area?
2) Are their technical skills strong enough to begin engaging with the problems we're faced with?
3) Do they have instincts about product that will allow them to make decisions about implementation when things are unclear?
4) Are their career goals or motivations inline with the position/organization? (and will remain so for some time)

Rationale:

1) Motivation to work at project/company/area will give a candidate the drive to overcome any skill gaps, as well as moves to ensure the individual will have affinity with coworkers.

Many searches are focussed on finding candidates that have experience with the exact set of technologies used by the recruiting organization. I think this foolishly narrows the pool - the space of all technologies are very large and constantly changing. It privileges past experience over creativity. While I consider it important for a candidates to have experience in at least related technologies, someone who is motivated to solve the problems of an organization will be motivated to learn what tools they need to conquer the problems they're faced with. I'll bet on creativity of appropriately motivated individuals.

It's also important that there is cultural fit. If you think it's immoral to be a land-lord, I'll bet against your success in an organization building a business working with short-term vacation rental managers - you'll come into constant conflict with your team members on all kinds of matters.


2) Some baseline of technical abilities is obviously essential in a candidate for software engineer. So what indicators are there of competence in building functional and maintainable software systems are there? We've already set aside acquaintance with specific technologies. Not, too, that you the examiner may not be familiar with the technologies with which your candidate is most familiar.

I'm looking for evidence that an individual will be able to build a functional and maintainable software system. What are the skills involved? 

I look for
  - a sensitivity to and an ability to engage with the appropriate level of details.
  - a consciousness of your strengths
  - a consciousness of your limits (it is important to be able to admit when you're out of your depth or need help)

Software systems are complex. They shouldn't be complicated, but they are complex. They arise as the result of a dynamic interaction of a large number of (ideally simple) sub-systems. But then investigating when things go wrong.

Building software systems involves a negotiating a complex system of authorities - your system will be composed of a large variety of components, each with it's own responsibilities and interface. To be able to wrangle these systems, it takes a patience to figure out 

If I'm asking you to describe how authentication works between your client and server and you describe your system as RESTful, this doesn't show me that you understand authentication. It also communicates the probability of impedance 


I'm aware of a few templates of job advertisements. One comes from tech giants like Google or Facebook. These descriptions are looking for people interested in general problem solvers with some technical abilities and computer science fundamentals to work on 

I find job descriptions that have a laundry list of technologies to be
